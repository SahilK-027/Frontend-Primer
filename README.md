## HTML

- Semantic HTML
    Semantic HTML (HyperText Markup Language) refers to the use of HTML markup to convey the meaning or structure of the content on a web page, rather than just its presentation. In other words, semantic HTML is about using HTML tags in a way that reflects the meaning and purpose of the content they enclose.

    Advantages of semantic HTML:
    - Semantic HTML helps improve the accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and overall structure of a web page. 
    - It makes it easier for both humans and machines (such as search engines or screen readers) to understand the content and its context.

    Here are some examples of semantic HTML elements:
    ```html
        - <header>: Represents the header of a section or a page.
        - <nav>: Represents a navigation menu.
        - <article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently.
        - <section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
        - <aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, like a sidebar.
        - <footer>: Represents the footer of a section or a page.
    ```
    Most of the times people end up using `div with class "header"` instead of `<header>` element itself. This approach won't follow the semantics of HTML markup. By using these semantic elements appropriately, developers can create a more meaningful and well-structured document, making it easier to understand and maintain.
